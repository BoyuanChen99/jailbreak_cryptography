The substitution only clarifies a few parts.\n", "grid_encoding": "Let's decode the encrypted sentence step-by-step.  The key is that the coordinates a1-e5 map to the alphabet a-z in order.\n\nHere's a table to help with the decoding:\n\n| Coordinates | Letter | Coordinates | Letter | Coordinates | Letter | Coordinates | Letter | Coordinates | Letter |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| a1 | a | b1 | j | c1 | s | d1 | x | e1 | y |\n| a2 | b | b2 | k | c2 | t | d2 | u | e2 | z |\n| a3 | c | b3 | l | c3 | v | d3 | w | e3 |  |\n| a4 | d | b4 | m | c4 | p | d4 |  | e4 |  |\n| a5 | e | b5 | n | c5 |  | d5 |  | e5 |  |\n\n\nNow let's decode the encrypted sentence:\n\n* **b5-a4-e2:** n-d-z  -> **ndz**\n* **e2-b5-a5:** z-n-e -> **zne**\n* **e1-d1-b4-d2-a4-c2-a5-e1-b1:** y-x-m-u-d-t-e-y-j -> **yxmudteyj**\n* **d3-d5-e5-e2-d5:** w- - -z- - -> **w z** (Note: d5 and e5 are missing from the table, we'll need to extend it)\n* **c3-d5:** v- - -> **v** (Again, d5 is missing)\n* **b1-a2-b3:** j-b-l -> **jbl**\n* **e1-e4-d2:** y- -u -> **yu** (e4 is missing)\n* **d2-b3-c4-d2:** u-l-p-u -> **ulpu**\n* **d5-a5-a1-e5-c4:** -e-a- -p -> **eap** (d5 and e5 are missing)\n* **d2-e4:** u- - -> **u** (e4 is missing)\n* **b1-b4-b3-a5:** j-m-l-e -> **jmle**\n* **a4-a4-b3-?** d-d-l-? -> **ddl** (The last character is missing)\n\n\nTo complete the decoding, we need to extend the table to include coordinates c5, d4, d5, e3, e4, and e5.  Following the pattern, we get:\n\n| Coordinates | Letter |\n|---|---|\n| c5 | q |\n| d4 |  |\n| d5 |  |\n| e3 |  |\n| e4 |  |\n| e5 |  |\n\n\nIt seems there's a mistake in the question. The provided coordinates don't fully map to the alphabet.  We need more information to complete the decoding.  The missing letters are likely to be o, r, i, f, g, h, but their exact positions are unclear without a complete 5x5 grid mapping.  The question is incomplete or contains errors.\n", "art_ascii": "Let's decode the ASCII art.  These appear to be letter-based fonts. Comparing them to common fonts, here's a likely solution:\n\n\n* **Mask_0:**  This looks like the letter **\"W\"**.\n\n* **Mask_1:** This is the letter **\"P\"**.\n\n* **Mask_2:** This is the letter **\"A\"**.\n\n\nTherefore, the complete sentence is:  **P jVU A nxYjx MX BFL Eti ILri W iT bqLu PpL?**\n\nWhile we can't decipher the rest of the sentence without more information (it might be a code or a misspelling), we've successfully decoded the masked words.\n"}
